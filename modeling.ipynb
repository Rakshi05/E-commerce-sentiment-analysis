should buy this? Anyone with a sensitive skin like me, especially the soft areas like armpits. Where applying alcohol based scents burns the skin.  So, this is non-alcoholic but has a mint freshness though. Has a subtle scent. Something that can't be smelt by others when in close contact but surely won't let the odor out for at-least 8 hours even in heavy workloads.  Con: It's a sticky cream type thing which kind of hardens the skin and hairs from where it's applied and when bathing later, water skips that part entirely which is good or bad I don't know yet. Also I am reporting black spots after prolonged usage. So I am not telling you to not buy it but be careful if this is giving you problems.\n"]}],"source":["testing=input()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"402f4928","metadata":{"id":"402f4928"},"outputs":[],"source":["import re\n","import string\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","# from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer \n","# ls = WordNetLemmatizer()\n","\n","def no_punc(text):\n","    docs = []\n","    text=split(text)\n","    text=text.lower()\n","    text=re.sub('[^A-Za-z]+', ' ',text)\n","    text = text.split()\n","    text=[ls.lemmatize(word) for word in text if word not in sw]\n","    text=' '.join(text)\n","    docs.append(text)\n","    return docs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d8ce7834","metadata":{"id":"d8ce7834"},"outputs":[],"source":["text_clean=no_punc(testing) # list type\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4ccaa032","metadata":{"id":"4ccaa032","outputId":"889d1dee-e2df-41cc-dac3-83a1ec0ce0cb"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Positive\n"]}],"source":["df2=vectorizer.transform(text_clean).toarray()\n","pred=cm.predict(df2)\n","label=pred[0]\n","\n","if label==2:\n","    print('Positive')\n","elif label==0:\n","    print('Negative')\n","else:\n","    print('Neutral')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"a9ecdbbd","metadata":{"id":"a9ecdbbd"},"outputs":[],"source":["from pickle import dump\n","dump(vectorizer,open('vectorizer.pkl','wb'))\n","dump(cm,open('model.pkl','wb'))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"baa1eca7","metadata":{"id":"baa1eca7"},"outputs":[],"source":["from pickle import load\n","\n","def predict(text):\n","    vector=load(open('vectorizer.pkl','rb'))\n","    classify=load(open('model.pkl','rb'))\n","    clean_text=no_punc(text)\n","    vector_clean_text=vector.transform(clean_text)\n","    vector_array=vector_clean_text.toarray()\n","    prediction=classify.predict(vector_array)\n","    return prediction"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"45454837","metadata":{"id":"45454837","outputId":"96fd0bed-27f0-42eb-cb98-66b420ca6198"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["I've been using it for around 2 months.
